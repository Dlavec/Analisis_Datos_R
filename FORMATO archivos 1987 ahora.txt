                  Definitions of various parameters

Climat temperature is the final corrected monthly mean temperature reported 
by a station.
                                  

Apparent temperature is an equivalent temperature that measures the degree 
of human discomfort due to combined heat and humidity.  It is based on studies
of human physiology and textile (clothing) science.  The apparent temperature
is designed so that it exceeds the air temperature when humidity is relatively
high.  The apparent temperature does not consider the effects of air
movement (wind speed) or exposure to sunshine.  


Wind chill is an equivalent temperature that measure the degree of physical 
discomfort and stress from combined cold and wind.  It was developed from
physiological studies of the of the rate of heat loss for various combinations
of ambient temperature and wind speed. The wind chill equals the air
temperature when the wind speed is 4 MPH or less.  At higher wind speeds, the
wind chill is lower than the air temperature and measures the
increased rate of heat loss from the body under windy conditions. 


Pan evaporation is the amount of moisture which is transformed from water to 
vapor as measured in a cylindrical pan (class-A pan) with a depth of ten
inches and a diameter of forty-eight inches.  The pan is filled with water
to a depth of eight inches and periodically measured.  When the water level 
drops to seven, the pan is refilled.
 

Total radiation is the sum of direct solar radiation also known as the beam
component and scattered radiation.  Direct radiation is beamed straight from
the sun to the earth with no deviation, while scattered radiation takes a less
direct route from sun to earth.


Vapor pressure deficit is the difference between the saturation vapor pressure
and the actual vapor pressure.
 

A heating degree day is an index used to quantify the amount of heating 
required for houses or businesses for a given day.  Heating degree days for a
given period are the summations of negative differences between the mean daily
temperature (F) and the base temperature of 65F for that period.
The  heating year  extends from July 1 to June 30.
 

A cooling degree day is an index used to quantify the amount of cooling 
required for houses or businesses for a given day.  Cooling degree days
for a given period are the summations of positive differences between the
mean daily temperature (F) and the base temperature of 65F for that period.
The cooling year  extends from January 1 to December 31.

 
A growing degree day is an index used to express crop maturity.  Growing 
degree days for a given period are the summations of the positive
differences between the mean daily temperature (F) and the base temperature
of 50F for that period.  Temperatures above 86F are set equal to 86.  
The  growing  season  extends from March 1 to November 2.
